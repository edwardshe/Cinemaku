Cinemaku is an application that takes a novel approach to movie recommendations. Users enter a the title of a movie they enjoyed and Cinemaku begins working, by crawling the web to find stills of the movie. Using the Clarifai API, these movie stills are analyzed and digested to yield a set of "tags", which describe the visual content of the movie based on some of its most important scenes. By doing so, Cinemaku is able to identify certain visual aspects of movies that appeal to viewers which maybe unknown to them. After tags are identified, Cinemaku again takes to the web, this time leveraging the capabilities of Google Search API to find titles with similar visual characteristics as determined using the Clarifai API. After detailed visual analysis of numerous movies, users are presented with an ordered list of recommendations! 

Cinemaku derives its name from cinema and 'maku', the Japanese term for 'recommendation'. We were inspired to create this product after noticing an alarming underappreciation for the visual aspects of film. We believe that elegant cinematography is, at its core, the art of creating beautiful motion pictures. Cinemaku aims to fundamentally alter the way movies are appreciated in the current day, by returning viewers to the roots of film.
